# bilibili_elegance-data-analysis
Based on the analysis process of big data, this paper uses the octopus collector to collect data, uses Python for data cleaning and analysis, and integrates pyecharts and Tableau for data visualization. It mainly relies on Python related packages and machine learning to realize data analysis.

There are four source files and one dataset. The.py file is concise and can be run once, while the.ipynb file provides a more intuitive view of the analysis results. Run data cleaning first for data cleaning, and then data analysis for data analysis and visualization.
